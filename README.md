nary Trees Repository

Welcome to the Binary Trees Repository! This repository contains various implementations and resources related to binary trees.

## About Binary Trees
Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science used for organizing and managing hierarchical data efficiently. Each node in a binary tree has at most two children, typically referred to as the left child and the right child.
